# List of Online Resources

This is a list of resources that helped me understand both astronomical postions and timekeeping.

## 1. Sun Position & Visualization
[Website: suncalc](https://www.suncalc.org/#/37.7259,-89.2152,12/2025.06.13/21:48/1/2)

[![Tracking the Sun for Your Bird Outing: SunCalc | 365 Days of Birds](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.wZYpi-inAKWv5jR4iVzpiAHaEK\&pid=Api)](https://www.365daysofbirds.com/2023/08/11/tracking-the-sun-for-your-bird-outing-suncalc/)

SunCalc is a free, browser-based tool that helps you visualize and calculate the sun’s path and sunlight phases for any date and location. It overlays an interactive map with:

* An orange arc showing the sun’s trajectory for your selected date.
* Yellow shading showing the range of paths over the year.
* Colored radial lines pinpointing sunrise, solar noon, and sunset times.
* A time slider that highlights when it's dawn, daylight, dusk, or night at that place.

It also displays key solar data like azimuth (compass direction), altitude (angle above horizon), shadow length (based on object height), and the time of various twilight phases.

Developed by Volodymyr (Vladimir) Agafonkin using JavaScript and Google Maps, SunCalc is popular among photographers, planners, OSINT investigators, and astronomy enthusiasts.

## 2. Sun & Moon Times
[Webiste: Sun & Moon Times](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/usa/carbondale)

Timeanddate.com’s “Astronomy” page for Carbondale, IL (or your selected location) provides a comprehensive daily overview of solar and lunar events tailored to your location:

* **Sun & Moon Times**: Displays today's sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase information specific to Carbondale.
* **Daylight Breakdown**: Shows total daylight hours and how they compare to previous and future days, with precise times for civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight.
* **Sun Path Graphs**: Interactive charts illustrating the Sun’s altitude and heading throughout the day, with hover-to-see-time details.
* **Moon Details**: Includes moon phase, altitude, direction, distance, upcoming new/full moons, and rise/set schedules for the month .
* **Night Sky & Planet Info**: An interactive sky map highlights which planets and stars are visible, with customized rise/set times and positions.
* **Eclipse Calendar**: Lists upcoming solar and lunar eclipses visible from Carbondale, complete with types and dates.

In short, it's a location-specific astronomy planner offering real-time and forecasted sun, moon, twilight, night-sky, and eclipse data—all through interactive charts and maps tailored for Carbondale.

## 3. Current UTC Time
[Website: UTC Time Now](https://www.utctime.net/)

### What the website does — UTCtime.net

* Displays the **current UTC date and time** in multiple formats—24‑hour, 12‑hour (AM/PM), ISO‑8601, RFC, Unix epoch seconds, and more.
* Includes a **UTC time converter**, letting you convert any UTC time to over a hundred time zones (e.g., EST, CST, PST, Zulu) and vice versa.
* Provides a **UTC timestamp tool**, showing the current moment in epoch seconds to serve software, API, or logging needs.
* Lists **timezone abbreviations and offsets**, and offers specialized converters (UTC → EST, CST, PST, etc.) with tables for all 24-hour values .
* Created by a small developer team focused on simplicity, precision, and ease of use—plus they offer a Chrome extension for real-time UTC display.

### What is *UTC* (Coordinated Universal Time) ?

* **UTC** is the global time standard used widely across computing, aviation, weather forecasting, navigation, and international communications—effectively succeeding the old GMT standard.
* Based on atomic clocks (International Atomic Time, TAI), UTC occasionally adds **leap seconds**—usually on June 30 or December 31—to stay aligned (within 0.9 s) with Earth’s rotation.
* UTC is expressed with offsets like “+00:00” or simply “Z”/“Zulu time.” Local times worldwide are defined as UTC ± X hours—but UTC itself never observes Daylight Saving Time.


### Summary:

* **UTCtime.net** is a clean and precise tool for displaying and converting UTC time, showing epoch timestamps, human-readable formats, and across-the-board time zone conversions.
* **UTC** itself is the atomic, leap‑second‑adjusted global time standard that underpins nearly all digital and international timekeeping systems.

## 4. Current Unix Time
[Website: Unix Time](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)


### What the website does — UnixTimestamp.com

* It's a **free, web-based Unix epoch converter** that displays the current Unix timestamp (number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970) and lets you convert between:

  * Unix timestamps (seconds, milliseconds, µs)
  * Human-readable dates (and vice versa)
* It highlights the significance of “Unix Epoch time” and alerts visitors to the upcoming 32-bit overflow issue in January 2038, known as the **Year 2038 problem**.


### What is *Unix time* (aka Unix timestamp) ?

* **Unix time** is a system to represent a specific moment by counting the number of seconds elapsed since **January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC**, known as the **Unix Epoch**.
* It’s widely used in computing—by Unix/Linux systems, programming languages, databases, and APIs—for easy timekeeping, comparison, and arithmetic, without dealing with calendars or time zones .
* On most systems, it's stored as a signed 32-bit integer, which will overflow on **January 19, 2038** (“Year 2038 problem”)—many platforms have now switched to 64-bit to avoid this.
* Unix time typically **ignores leap seconds**, counting uniform seconds instead—making it simple but not perfectly aligned with astronomical UTC.


### Summary

* **UnixTimestamp.com** is a handy epoch converter and real-time timestamp viewer.
* **Unix time** (or epoch time) is a compact, universal integer count of seconds since 1970‑01‑01 UTC, essential in computing but limited by data type size and leap-second handling.
